# Coffee Connection

In order to connect you with you new best friend, Coffee Conneciton asks the user a series of questions to get you know the user. The app then runs an algorithm in order to find the best match for the user. The rest is up to the user! Go get a coffee, get some icecream.. we've done our part, you do yours now.
